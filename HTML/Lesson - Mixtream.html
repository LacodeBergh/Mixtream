        <img class = "sheet-music" src = "/Volumes/LDRIVE 2/Web Design/Projects/Mixtream/Images/Sheet Music - Mixtream-02.jpg">
        <p>Writing drums can be somewhat daunting if you are a novice musician. Most people tend to want
        to write the most complicated rhythms imaginable with little consinderation for the other instruments
        in the composition. The above drum groove illustrates
        the ability to take a simple 4/4 rock groove and displace the kick in the 4th bar by a by 16th
        note (Semiquaver) in order to give the section and odd-time feel. Remember to only play the crash
        at the start of every 4th bar or 8th bar, depending on the tempo and\or style of the song. In this
        case we will apply the 8 bar rule.</p>

          <h3 class = "heading">The Bass Guitar</h3>
          <img class = "sheet-music" src = "/Volumes/LDRIVE 2/Web Design/Projects/Mixtream/Images/Sheet Music - Mixtream-03.jpg">
          <p>The bass guitar. An instrument that is easy to learn, yet, tough to master. I used the key of C
          and played the mode known as the harmonic minor, or The Egyptian Scale. This mode has been used to
          write many songs, especially within the Metal genre, as the mode tends to have rather dark medlodic
          content. This bass line can also be used in a funk fusion song, if you up the tempo to 120bpm. However,
          for the sake of this lesson, spend some time recording this line at the tempo of 70bpm. The progression
          is as follows: <br><br>
          C A C E&#9837; B&#9837; D</p>

            <img class = "sheet-music" src = "/Volumes/LDRIVE 2/Web Design/Projects/Mixtream/Images/Sheet Music - Mixtream-01.jpg">
            <p>The above guitar riff/melody is a simple improvisation over the Harmonic Minor Mode. Spend some time practicing
            this until you are comfortable enough to start writing your own version.</p>

                190Hz. This will cancel out 200Hz which will allow for the Kick drum to cut through the mix. </td>
