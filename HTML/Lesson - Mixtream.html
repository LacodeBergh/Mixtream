      <p>Writing drums can be somewhat daunting if you are a novice musician as most people tend to want
        to write the most complicated rhythms imaginable with little consinderation for the other instruments
        in the composition (or mix, if you are purely sound engineer). The above drum groove illustrates
        the ability to take a simple 4/4 rock groove and displacing the kick in the 4th bar by a by 16th
        note (Semiquaver) in order to give the section and odd-time feel. Remember to only play the crash
        at the start of every 4th bar or 8th bar, depending on the tempo and\or style of the song. In the
        case of the current piece that we are writing now, which is a very laid-back nu-metal verse section,
        we will apply to the 8 bar rule.</p>

        <img class = "sheet-music" src = "/Web Design/Projects/Mixtream/Images/Sheet Music - Mixtream-03.jpg">
        <p>The bass guitar. An instrument that is easy to learn, yet, tough to master. I used the key of C
        and played the mode known as the harmonic minor, or The Egyptian Scale. This mode has been used to
        write many song, especially in the Metal genre, as it the mode tends to have rather dark medlodic
        content. This bass line can also be used in a funk fusion song, if you up the tempo to 120bpm. However,
        for the sake of this lesson, spend some time recording this line at the tempo of 70bpm. The progression
        is as follows: <br><br>
        C A C D</p>
