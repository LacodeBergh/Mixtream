            <td>An Apple Imac, Macbook, or Mac mini is highly recommended as a start to get the best out of this lesson series.
            This is due to the fact that Apple owns a DAW known as Logic, which is one of the most affordable and user-friendly
            pieces of software on the market, plus the resale value on Apple computers is great and you are able to get a
            secondhand imac for as little as R4000-00 and it is guaranteed to work beautifully. PC is also pretty good, but if you
            are limited in funding, software will be hard to come by as logic is Mac-only. If you are looking for something specific,
            however, feel free to keep reading below as we make suggestions on a number of DAWs to help you decide which may be best
            suited for you.</td>
